# Renormalization Recon — Synthesis (2026-07-03)

Three-agent data reconnaissance over this repo (no proofs attempted; all
claims backed by artifacts under `renorm_check/`). Independently
spot-checked: the C=148 divergence (recomputed at 50 digits), the
48-widths phrasing (COLLATZ_PROOF.md:230 vs LOCK3 grid's own caveat), and
the credit-sequence code split (grep of both Rust tools).

## F1 — The capacity formula is a convergent shadow (beatty/)

22/53 is an exact continued-fraction convergent of 2−log₂3 (next:
127/306). The published formula M_edge(C)=⌊53(C+1)/22⌋ and its
irrational-slope analogue ⌊(C+1)/(2−log₂3)⌋ agree for ALL C ≤ 147 and
first diverge at **C=148** (358 vs 359); divergences then densify to
~99.8% and grow linearly (~330 extra levels by C=10⁶). Every genuine
measurement ever run lives at C ≤ 50 — inside the agreement zone. **The
true capacity law past C=147 is empirically undetermined.** No
non-trivial exact Beatty representation of the rational form exists
(only algebraic restatements matched) — consistent with the rational
form being a shadow, not a law.

## F2 — The tools split across the rational/irrational divide (code)

- `spectral_radius*.rs`: builds credits for steps 0..53 and **cycles the
  block** → the ρ certificates describe the *periodicized* (53/22)
  operator by construction.
- `lock3_census.rs`: `credit_at_step(k)=⌊(k+1)α⌋−⌊kα⌋`, **unbounded k**
  → countdown/census measurements run on the TRUE aperiodic word.

Consequence: the decisive experiment (F5) is runnable with existing
tooling and is NOT circular. Precision caveat: credits use f64; deep
ladders should switch to exact Ostrowski/integer arithmetic before
trusting floors near convergent denominators.

## F3 — ρ(C) is constant, not periodic (renorm_check/ top level)

Freshly regenerated with the repo's own binary: ρ locks bit-identical
above a small transient (C≥11 at m=3, C≥23 at m=5, all anchors to
C=200). Confirms Certificate 6's "universal constant" narrative with new
data; kills the ρ-periodicity version of the renormalization idea. Any
self-similarity lives in the m-direction (see F4). Tool ceiling
documented: C=200 at m=6 exceeds 10GB (SparseMat::add linear scan).

## F4 — The self-embedding conjecture SURVIVES, two candidates (embedding/)

Faithful reimplementation (validated against Lemma 3, M_edge C=1..5, and
LOCK3 zero-birth edges — all exact). Tested A(C,m) ↪ A(C+22, m+53):

- (b) r→r·3⁵³ maps: **refuted structurally** (100% dead — forward-image
  residues never ≡0 mod 3; 3⁵³≡0 mod 3).
- (a') identity + deficit shift: **dead** (49 failures).
- (a) identity (same d, r verbatim at larger modulus): **48 matched /
  0 failed / 67 inconclusive** — zero counterexamples.
- (c) advance-one-heartbeat-then-embed: **81 matched / 0 failed / 34
  inconclusive** — best decidability, zero counterexamples, and the
  dynamically natural map (respects the flow rather than raw identity).

Honest scope: C=1..5 pairs only, oracle-capped, sampled (115 elements).
Positive-but-unproven; (c) is the live conjecture.

## Coherence picture

F1+F3+F4 fit one story: the framework's real structure lives at the
IRRATIONAL/CF level. The rational formula, the periodic ρ, and the exact
+22→+53 periodicity are all first-order shadows of an almost-periodic
(Ostrowski-graded) renormalization — exactly how Sturmian systems
renormalize in the literature (period 53/22 block, then 306/127
correction, ...). If F5 returns 359, the paper's law gets upgraded to
the irrational form, the embedding becomes almost-periodic (occasional
+54 steps where the CF corrects), and the three-distance/gapped-repeats
machinery (arXiv 2606.02071's world) becomes the native proof toolkit.

## F5 — THE DECISIVE EXPERIMENT (registered)

**Run a genuine countdown ladder at C=148 with lock3_census (true-word
tool), exact-arithmetic credits.** Measured edge ∈ {358, 359}.
- 359 → law is Sturmian-fundamental (irrational). Correct the paper's
  formula; renormalization route strengthens; register follow-ups at the
  next divergence points from beatty/task3_divergences.csv.
- 358 → the automaton's rational construction binds deeper than the
  slope; the framework needs a convergent-upgrade story at large C and
  the G2 drift concern sharpens.
Registered prediction (Fable, 2026-07-03): **359.**
Secondary: repeat at 2-3 more early divergence points; confirm
non-divergence controls (C=147, 149) return the shared value.

## v1.1 correction list (published bundle)

1. COLLATZ_PROOF.md:230 — "48 independently measured corridor widths"
   → honest phrasing: 3 full countdown ladders (C=3,4,5) + 45 widths at
   m=1 with algebraically implied cutoffs (restore the backup version's
   own caveat).
2. Add the convergent-shadow caveat to the capacity formula: exact
   agreement with the irrational law only guaranteed for C ≤ 147; true
   law past that pending F5.
3. Certificates 6 and 9 are narrative-only (no artifacts in repo).
   Regenerate and archive raw outputs under certs/ (regenerations so far
   MATCH published numbers — claims hold, receipts missing).
4. Note the periodicized-operator scope of the ρ certificates (F2).

## Next work orders (no GPU, Codex/Sonnet-shaped)

- W1: exact-credit patch to lock3_census + C=148/controls ladder (F5).
- W2: exhaustive verification of embedding candidate (c) at the smallest
  pair (C=1→23) via the backward-oracle without sampling caps; if it
  survives exhaustively, promote to formal conjecture and attempt the
  commuting-diagram proof (it follows the dynamics — likely provable).
- W3: certs/ archival job (regenerate Certificates 6 & 9 artifacts).
- W4: G3 digit-density scan (support-phase pins nonzero digits at
  positive density along scattered-exit chains) — untouched this round.

## Execution notes (for the implementing agent — binding)

1. **W1 order of operations is load-bearing.** The exact-arithmetic
   credit patch (integer/Ostrowski credits, no f64 floors) lands and is
   regression-tested BEFORE the C=148 ladder runs — a single float floor
   flipping near a convergent denominator silently poisons the one
   number this recon exists to measure. Validate the patched credits by
   reproducing the C=3,4,5 genuine ladders exactly. The C=148 run is
   invalid without its controls: C=147 and C=149 must return the
   shared (non-divergent) values or the result does not count.
2. **W2 discipline.** Exhaustive candidate-(c) at the smallest pair
   (C=1→23), no sampling caps, no oracle-call ceiling shortcuts that
   convert "inconclusive" into silence. Exhaustive survival =
   promotion to FORMAL CONJECTURE, stated precisely — not "proven."
   The commuting-diagram proof attempt is a separate later act.
3. **Ledger law applies.** Update this file (or a sibling
   IMPLEMENTATION_LEDGER.md in this directory) after every completed
   step: what ran, the command/artifact that proves it, what remains.
   Commit after every completed work item — this repo is PUBLIC; the
   self-audit publishing before the paper's v1.1 correction is a
   deliberate choice of this house (we ship our own red team), so
   commit messages should be written to be read by strangers.
4. **Registered prediction on record (Fable, 2026-07-03): the C=148
   genuine countdown edge = 359** (irrational law). If the measurement
   returns 358, that prediction is wrong and gets recorded as wrong in
   this file, same rules as everyone else. The result is the result.

## F5 AMENDMENT (2026-07-03, PRE-DATA — method only; question, prediction, controls unchanged)

The original F5 method (full countdown ladder at C=148) is computationally
infeasible: the edge sits at m≈358 and anything enumeration-shaped dies at
3^m long before that. No C=148 data exists at amendment time — this is a
method substitution, not a result-driven change. The registered elements
stand as written: binary question (edge = 358 vs 359), prediction 359
(Fable), exact-arithmetic credits mandatory, result invalid without
controls.

**Amended method — edge-witness search:**
1. The question reduces to one bit: does ANY lineage survive at
   (C=148, m=359)? Depth-first witness search with pruning (memory
   O(depth)), and/or backward search from candidate terminal states at
   m=359 using the validated backward-reachability oracle from
   embedding/. Near-edge survivor populations are tiny by definition
   (cf. the C=3 Last Survivor: a single residue).
2. **Pre-declared asymmetry:** witness FOUND at m=359 ⇒ edge ≥ 359 ⇒
   decisive for the irrational law. Witness NOT found ⇒ suggestive of
   358 ONLY if the search is demonstrably exhaustive (memoized full
   frontier or a completeness argument); otherwise the result is
   INCONCLUSIVE and must be reported as such — a null from a capped
   search does not count as 358.
3. **Method validation (replaces ladder controls, same spirit):** the
   witness-search implementation must first reproduce the known edges
   exactly — C=3→10, C=4→13, C=5→15 (witness at edge, exhaustive-empty
   at edge+1) — and then the agreement-zone controls: C=147 and C=149
   edges at their shared predicted values (witness at m=predicted,
   behavior at m=predicted+1 consistent). Only then does C=148 run.
4. **Telescoping option (couples W2 to F5):** 148 = 16 + 6·22, so six
   applications of embedding candidate (c) — if W2 proves it exact —
   map the C=148/m≈358 question to the C=16 edge at m≈40
   (M_edge(16)=40, both laws agree at 16). If the embedding is exact,
   the discrimination localizes to whether it remains exact through the
   CF-correction steps; the defect location IS the answer. W2's
   exhaustive result therefore feeds F5 directly.
5. Frontier-width calibration before committing compute: use the
   C=3,4,5 survivor-count profiles to model expected search width at
   148; if projected width exceeds feasibility even for witness search,
   report the wall honestly and fall back to the telescoping route.

## Execution round 1 results (2026-07-03) — see IMPLEMENTATION_LEDGER.md

W1 patch landed and validated (C=3,4,5 ladders reproduce exactly).
Frontier-width calibration (item 5 above) ran as designed: oracle call
counts scale ~7-8x per unit C (C=3→235K, C=4→5.46M, C=5→33.4M calls),
confirming witness search cannot reach C=148 directly — **the wall is
real, reported honestly, and the telescoping route (item 4) is the only
remaining path.** W2's own exhaustive test hit the same wall one step
earlier than hoped: (C=1,m=1)→(23,54) confirms candidate (c) exactly
(4/4, zero counterexamples) but that pair is degenerate (trivial residue
collapse); the next meaningful pair (C=1,m=4, 819 states) did not
resolve exhaustively within reasonable time/memory, so telescoping is
currently BLOCKED on W2, not W1. **F5 remains OPEN: 358 vs 359 undecided
by any method run so far.** W3 (certs/ archival) is DONE — both
certificates independently reproduced, including two headline scaling
laws (6.18×(C+1) and 3.34×(C+1)) matching to <1% at large C. W4 scoped
but not executed. Full detail in IMPLEMENTATION_LEDGER.md.
